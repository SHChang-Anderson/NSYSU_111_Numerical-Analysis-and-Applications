# HW3

[Design Filtering and Verify Integration Error with Two-Point Gauss-Legendre Formula.]

## Installation

This project requires [matplotlib, numpy, cv2].


## Usage

 - Run 1.py to compute the difference between the integral results using Scipy's import integrate and the Two Point Gauss Quadrature Rule.

 - Run 2a.py to design high-pass and low-pass filters and display the filtered image results separately.

 - Run 2b.py to display the processed image of DemoIMG_1.png using a low-pass filter. The threshold value for the filter is adjustable.

 - Run 2c.py to display the processed image of DemoIMG_1.png using a high-pass filter. The threshold value for the filter is adjustable.

 - Run 2d.py to combine the filtered DemoIMG_1.png with DemoIMG_6.png and display the resulting image. The threshold values for the low-pass and high-pass filters are adjustable.
