# Numerical Analysis and Applications HW2

## Requirements

- Python 3.10.10
- Matplotlib

## Usage

### Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel Methods with λ

1. To observe the convergence effect of Jacobi method with λ, run `python jacobiwithld.py`
2. To observe the convergence effect of Gauss-Seidel method with λ, run `python Gauss-Seidelwithld.py`
3. Change the value of λ in the respective files to observe convergence under different values.

### Plots for Normal Distribution

1. To plot the figure comparing normal distribution, run `python 3a.py` or `python 3b.py`
2. To observe mean and standard deviation at different lengths, run `python 3c.py`

### Regression Analysis

1. To find the distribution of ω after 20000 regression, run `python 3e.py`
2. To find the distribution of ω after 20000 regression using weighting function, run `python 3f.py`
